The Libsyn Publisher Hub plugin allows Libsyn producers to publish their podcast right from Wordpress for easy management of their show.

== Description ==

**Libsyn Hosting Account Required**

Not already hosting with Libsyn? Sign up at <http://www.libsyn.com>, or contact *<support@libsyn.com>* for details.

Libsyn’s Publishing Hub allows for the perfect workflow for publishing podcast episodes straight from Wordpress and into your Libsyn show. Features such as episode creation, Apple Podcasts optimization tags, creating ID3 tags, automated feed/show migrations, pulling in previously published episodes, and advanced scheduling bring some of the best of Libsyn’s publishing options to your Wordpress website.

Media file uploads direct to Libsyn, as well as by using already loaded Wordpress media or access your Libsyn FTP Dropbox all from one place.

The best part is your media files stay hosted with Libsyn, and your RSS feed will still be generated by Libsyn as well, meaning your web hosting server remains unaffected by your podcast and your RSS feed and media files are unaffected by your web hosting server. It’s the best of both worlds.
