You can choose which tutorial videos to show in the list, or even embed your own custom videos!

== Installation ==

1. Go to [WP101Plugin.com](https://wp101plugin.com/) to get your API key.
2. Copy your API key from your [WP101Plugin.com](https://app.wp101plugin.com/) dashboard.
3. Install and activate the WP101 Plugin in the 'Plugins' panel.
4. Go to the Video Tutorials menu item and click the Settings button to enter your API key.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get an API key? =

Simply go to: [WP101Plugin.com](https://wp101plugin.com/) and follow the instructions to set up an API key in less than a minute.

= Can I choose which video topics are displayed? =

Yes! You can selectively hide or show individual tutorial videos (or entire courses) through the app at [WP101Plugin.com](https://app.wp101plugin.com).

= Can I add my own custom videos? =

Yes! You can add your own custom videos, and they'll appear at the bottom of the list of tutorial videos. Visit the “Custom Videos” page in the [WP101 Plugin app](https://app.wp101plugin.com/custom-topics).

= What if I have the Classic Editor installed? =

If the Classic Editor plugin is also installed and activated on your site, the previous version of our WordPress 101 videos for the Classic Editor in WordPress 4.9 and older will also appear in the list. You can hide or show these videos in the Settings.

= Why aren’t the WooCommerce, Jetpack, or Yoast SEO videos showing up? =

The tutorial videos for WooCommerce, Jetpack, and Yoast SEO will only appear in the list if the plugin in question is also installed and activated on the same site. No sense showing videos that don’t apply to a particular site, right?

= The plugin was installed by my developer, but their API key has expired. What do I do? =

You can ask your developer to renew their subscription, or you can go to [WP101Plugin.com](https://wp101plugin.com/) to start your own Solo Site subscription and get access to all of our videos.

= Can I hardcode my API key into the plugin for use across multiple installations?  =

Yes! Simply define the `WP101_API_KEY` constant within your `wp-config` file:

	/**
	 * API key for the WP101 plugin.
	 *
	 * @link https://wp101plugin.com
	 */
	define( 'WP101_API_KEY', 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' );

= I've been using the WP101 Plugin for some time now — will upgrading to 5.x break my site? =

We've made every effort to ensure a smooth transition to version 5.x of the WP101 plugin from earlier versions:

* Upon upgrading, your existing API key will be exchanged for a new API key automatically.
* If you've defined the API key via the `WP101_API_KEY` constant, you'll be given instructions for updating the value.
* Hidden courses and videos will automatically be passed to the WP101 Plugin app as part of the exchange, and will be reflected automatically. No more having to filter out videos!

== Screenshots ==

1. The video tutorial selection and viewing interface.
2. Add your own custom videos and deploy them to one or more sites.
3. Choose to hide or show individual videos—or an entire series—on a per-domain basis.
4. Manage all your client domains remotely, from one dashboard.
5. With a Pro License, you can also embed the 31-part WordPress 101 video series on the front-end of your membership site.
6. Use one API key across all your sites, or generate unique API keys as needed.
